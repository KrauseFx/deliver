# Installation

Install the gem

    sudo gem install deliver

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Quick Start

The guide will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```deliver init```
- Enter your iTunes Connect credentials
- Enter your app identifier
- Enjoy a good drink, while the computer does all the work for you

From now on, you can run `deliver` to deploy a new update, or just upload new app metadata and screenshots.

Already using `deliver` and just updated to 1.0? Check out the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/fastlane/deliver/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md).

# Usage

Check out your local `./fastlane/metadata` and `./fastlane/screenshots` folders (if you don't use [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) it's `./metadata` instead)

![/assets/metadata.png](/assets/metadata.png)

You'll see your metadata from iTunes Connect. Feel free to store the metadata in git (not the screenshots). You can now modify it locally and push the changes back to iTunes Connect.

Run `deliver` to upload the app metadata from your local machine

```
deliver
```

Provide the path to an `ipa` file to upload and submit your app for review:

```
deliver --ipa "App.ipa" --submit_for_review
```

If you use [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) you don't have to manually specify the path to your `ipa` file. 

This is just a small sub-set of what you can do with `deliver`, check out the full documentation in [Deliverfile.md](https://github.com/fastlane/deliver/blob/master/Deliverfile.md)

Download existing screenshots from iTunes Connect

```
deliver download_screenshots
```

To get a list of available options run

```
deliver --help
```

Check out [Deliverfile.md](https://github.com/fastlane/deliver/blob/master/Deliverfile.md) for more options.

# Credentials

A detailed description about your credentials is available on a [separate repo](https://github.com/fastlane/credentials_manager).

### How does this thing even work? Is magic involved? 🎩###

Your password will be stored in the Mac OS X keychain, but can also be passed using environment variables. (More information available on [CredentialsManager](https://github.com/fastlane/credentials_manager))

Before actually uploading anything to iTunes, ```deliver``` will generate a HTML summary of the collected data. 

`deliver` uses the following techniques under the hood:

- The iTMSTransporter tool is used to upload the binary to iTunes Connect. iTMSTransporter is a command line tool provided by Apple.
- For all metadata related actions `deliver` uses [spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/spaceship)

## Available language codes
```
no, en-US, en-CA, fi, ru, zh-Hans, nl-NL, zh-Hant, en-AU, id, de-DE, sv, ko, ms, pt-BR, el, es-ES, it, fr-CA, es-MX, pt-PT, vi, th, ja, fr-FR, da, tr, en-GB
```

## Default values

Deliver has a special language code which allows you to provide values that are not localised, and which will be used as defaults when you don’t provide a specific localised value.

You can use this either in json within your deliverfile, or as a folder in your metadata file.

Imagine that you have localised data for the following language codes:  ```en-US, de-DE, el, it```

You can set the following in your deliverfile

```
release_notes({
  'default => "Shiny and new”,
  'de-DE' => "glänzend und neu"
})
```

Deliver will use "Shiny and new" for en-US, el and it.

It will use "glänzend und neu" for de-DE.

You can do the same with folders

```
   default
      keywords.txt     
      marketing_url.txt
      name.txt
      privacy_url.txt
      support_url.txt
      release_notes.txt
   en-US
      description.txt
   de-DE
      description.txt
   el
      description.txt
   it
      description.txt
```

In this case, default values for keywords, urls, name and release notes are used in all localisations, but each language has a fully localised description



## Automatically create screenshots

If you want to integrate `deliver` with [snapshot](https://github.com/fastlane/snapshot), check out [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools)!

## Jenkins integration
Detailed instructions about how to set up `deliver` and `fastlane` in `Jenkins` can be found in the [fastlane README](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Jenkins.md).

## Firewall Issues

`deliver` uses the iTunes Transporter to upload metadata and binaries. In case you are behind a firewall, you can specify a different transporter protocol using

```
DELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS="-t DAV" deliver
```

## Limit
Apple has a limit of 150 binary uploads per day. 

## Editing the ```Deliverfile```
Change syntax highlighting to *Ruby*.
